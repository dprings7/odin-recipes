        <p>Chicken carbonara was my go-to meal for surviving at university.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package thick-cut bacon</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta</li>
            <li>⅓ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons ground black pepper, divided</li>
            <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, sliced</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Parmesan-Romano cheese blend</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Colby Jack cheese blend</li>
            <li>3 eggs, beaten</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Chop into small pieces when cool enough to handle.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and olive oil; cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>While pasta is cooking, melt butter in a large, deep skillet over low heat. Add chopped bacon, garlic, and 1 teaspoon pepper; sauté until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Increase heat to medium, add chicken, and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add whipping cream, Parmesan-Romano cheese, and remaining 2 teaspoons pepper to the skillet. Stir and cook until heated through, about 3 minutes. Add Colby-Jack cheese and stir until melted. Stir in beaten eggs and bring to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Add drained pasta and stir until coated with sauce.</li>
        </ol>
